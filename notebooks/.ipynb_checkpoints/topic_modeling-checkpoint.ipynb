       "I hate talking about things like this because people will think I'm doing it for attention but literally I'm so done with all this bs so called life. I'm 16 and I just find life getting worse, it all started when my classmate committed suicide when I was 11/12 and I just didn't believe it but it happened than around the same time I had trouble sleeping.. insomnia, than my dream was torn away because of back pain and than quit playing video games which was literally my whole life, started at the age of 7 and became addicted played everyday and was an insider while everyone was making friends, at the age of 13 I realized how lonely I was and I became depressed. I find it so hard to socialize with people and I just don't know what to say.. and I just started locking myself in the dark after school because I just didn't have the energy to deal with all this and I wanted to start learning and finally started thinking about school but I just didn't get enough sleep to able to handle school.. every year that passed by I just became more stressed, tired, low energy, memory became worse, angrier, more depressed, more exhausted, mentally ill and I just used porn to escape even if it was just for a second. YouTube and TV shows were the only thing that kept me from doing stupid things and one day I just snapped because I couldn't handle it anymore.. as I finished with grade and now go to a new school. The school say they care and they want to help me when I'm reality they don't do shit about it and they literally don't care.. the only friends that I can make are people that smoke and do drugs and this is coming from a person that loves to make people feel happy and laugh(the typical good guy) that just wants to make people lives better but I feel like nobody cares.. no one ever texts me, my crush literally hates me for tagging her on a picture on fb and life just doesn't seem to get better, I've always been a person who could stay calm and handle all this but I just can't it just hurts to much and the outgoing people that i want to hang out with don't think I'm COOL enough.. WTF?! And the shy people just creep me out in a whole another level.. literally deep inside I'm outgoing but I just lack the social skills and don't have the confidence. I'm at my lowest point in life and I don't know who to talk to, I just feel weird talking to peoples that I used to go to school with especially people that didn't know me as well as my classmate.. because they liked me as a person but the grade below I just find it weird and not normal to just go and send them a message now after all these year where I barely talked to them, just wouldn't make sense.\\nfor the past 2 years, I feel like I haven't made any progress in life and really want to especially in 2017 and make it my year.\\n    1\n",

I hate going home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "I hate seeing other people my age and noticing how much more good looking they are than I. I know this has something to do with teenage hormones (M16) but it's gotten out of control. I can't even go to school anymore because of it. If I see anyone who's around my age I automatically compare myself to them and I can't stop it and it makes me hate myself so much. It's why I stay at home because if I'm at home then I can't see anyone but myself so I've got nobody to compare me to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "I hate seeing people suffer. So many people have severe depression and anxiety. This world sucks so much. Nobody should feel all this pain and feel so alone with it. Everything about my life is unfair and cruel but i still manage to hold on to that tiny piece of hope. I always try and help people, even though i feel everyone has given up on me. It gives me a purpose in life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

       "so my meds aren't working as the title says my meds aren't working. so far i've been on lexamil,clobazam,sertraline,trazodone and lithium carbonate and all of it has done absolutely nothing i've even been seeing a therapist for the past 6 months and that's done nothing either. so much for getting better amirite? life is just one complete hellhole at this stage and existence truly is pain i just wish it could all end here and now.  will i ever get better? my psychiatrist has started raising the hospitilisation question and i'm really not feeling it. on top of all that my anxiety just seems to be getting worse and worse as if i'm falling down an endless chasm. that's my life in a nutshell rn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2\n",
       "my friend needs help but i don't know how to get it to her. can you guys please help i have no idea who to ask. i'm almost 100% sure one of my friends has some form of depression. she constantly tells me that she thinks about dying and all that stuff. i'm giving her the diagnosis based on 11th grade health class, so it isn't certain, but almost everything she does and says points to depression. i told her that she should see a doctor or something to get a diagnosis or meds or something (i really don't know much about all this or how easy it is) but she said she can't because she doesn't have the money to go. her dad doesn't have insurance, and there's whole other problem with her mom so her mom won't take her. what can she do? i've been supporting her for months but it seems to be getting worse. is there anywhere she can get medication or treatment or anything at all? please help. thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "pathetic this fourth of july is my one year anniversary of a very trusted friend forcing himself on me. i’m spending it alone and listening to the fireworks reminds me of how he held me gently out on my deck while we watched before hand.  i feel pathetic, and like it doesn’t matter. he didn’t hit me, i didn’t fight very hard, and he was a handsome man. i feel like the people i would get comfort from talking to about it just think i’m looking for attention.  i know it wasn’t that bad, and i know there will be a day in the foreseeable future where this will not be painful anymore... but i feel pathetic and like it’s my fault. i wasn’t careful enough, and i will forever be cautious of letting men sleep in my bed.  i just wanted to tell someone how sad i am tonight. happy fourth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "please i feel like the only comfort i can get is posting here. i'm so done. i'm ready to give up. i tried killing myself with pills a year ago so i think i'll probably hang, because no one can stop me if i'm quick enough. i title this please because i want to be happy, i dont want to die... but i do at the same time. i can't see things getting better. therapy is something i want, but will never get. i can't go to the counsellors at school either because they belittle me and my problems... plus who wants to be the freak that has to talk to the counsellors? i dont know what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "i am way too unsuccessful in life so, long story short, i grew up myself. not literally, i have parents, i have siblings, had both my grandpas and grandmas until recently. but i did grow up myself. when i was young, i used to have a nanny. my parents would be either with my sibling, or at work. no one paid attention to me. i've tried many things that my family did just to connect with them, but they simply ignored me. my sibling had all the help he needed with school, was playing guitar with our father, and was helped in other subjects by our grandpa and grandma. i've never had that kind of help. i've had no one to show me the direction, what i must do in life. my sibling was always the \"guy\" in the school, had a bunch of relationships and stuff, but i was always the kid who can do pretty much anything, but nothing so good that someone takes notice. and recently when my parents have more time, they want to spend it with me, but i have no wish to spend it with them, because i've taken a completely opposite direction of what they wanted me to be. i have even seriously considered suicide in one point of my life. when i found a friend that i could speak with, on my \"level\", they would always become the cool guys and went up, started ignoring me and such. and recently, my life has been tearing apart. my sport career is going bad, like really bad. my school is the worst it has ever been, and i literally have nothing to do. i have no options. i have no one to go out with, i had someone, but they became the \"cool\" one. i know this may seem as that \"classic\" depressed kid, but i forgot how to feel. i don't feel anything. not bragging, but i might be the most good-looking guy in the school, and yet no one likes me just because i don't speak about mainstream things, like weed, alcohol and such. i do smoke weed, i do drink, but i do it to enjoy, not because i want everyone to know. i've tried new things, extreme sports and stuff, even extreme heights don't excite me one bit. when i have sex, i don't feel excited. it's just a thing to do. i can't feel. i'm thinking about buying some land in the wilderness somewhere and start living alone, without internet and stuff. i feel best when i'm alone. i think it's because i grew up alone, but i don't know. i've tried psychologists, doesn't work. i don't know. life just seems so dull and grey. i've thought about suicide as well, but that seems like such a stupid thing to do. i will try every single thing in my power to feel something again, either if that's sad, or happy, i just want to feel. if any of you had a life like this, a very lonely life, and somehow changed it, please advise me.    1\n",
       "steady decline and out date i thought that i was getting a little bit better but i got hit with this crap again. i went through my posts and i can really see how much i’ve declined in just the past few months. i’m just tired of fighting at this point so i’m wrapping things up here. i just can’t do it anymore. my out date is 8/5/18, i’m going to do it in a park, my keys will be in my book bag with a note as to whom to call and where to find my car at. a sealed note will be left for the person who i can trust will deliver my message to my family (because he actually cares about them) but i also know that he couldn’t give many shits about me enough to be affected by my suicide. i asked for help last time i was here and i started to come out of it. now i’m here again and i’m tired of fighting and i don’t want to ask for help. i seriously hate being a burden to those around me. i should have never opened up my mind to remember the trauma from my past. i can’t fight anymore and i can’t tell anyone who knows me what my plans are so i figured i would put them here and say goodbye to you guys. .....game over                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
