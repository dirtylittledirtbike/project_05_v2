       "      <th>My wife and her family have had a trip planned to go out of town for a fun weekend for a couple months now. My panic disorder started around the beginning of this year and I was really sure that I would be better by now. Up until April I had tried to kick it as naturally as possible with CBD oil, exercise, and other supplements, but it didn't work. So at the beginning of April I finally decided to go to the doctor. Since then, I've been on 50mg Zoloft daily, and .5mg clonazepam as needed. It's coming up on two months now and I don't really feel like its helping much. Of course when I get a panic attack and taking a clonazepam within the hour it seems to fade. But I still cant go anywhere or do anything without that feeling that a panic attack is surely going to happen. Especially going to unknown places or long car rides, both of which would have happened on the trip. So I had packed last night ready to power through this weekend and show my anxiety that I was in charge, until I woke up this morning with the worst feeling of dread and panic about the trip. I told my wife, who is absolutely amazing, she always understands and is supportive, that I didnt think I would be able to go. While she understood, I could see the disappointment. She just wants me to get better now, and so do I. Her family called to talk to me and asked if I'd taken a clonazepam this morning and if I were to wait an hour if I would be okay. But it's the car ride, the new locations, the elevators, the crowds, things of that nature that have me not able to go. So now I'm laying in bed crying, feeling like I let my wife down and myself down. I was really hoping to power through this weekend and that it would maybe even bring some healing. But I didnt. I avoided once again, and really feel like this is all hopeless at the moment. I keep telling myself to give it more time. Hopefully things change soon and my wife continues to love me.</th>\n",

       "      <th>My whole experience with anxiety and depression have just been so very very strange for me. This time 2 years ago I never would have said I had anxiety or depression, but at the end of this passed summer I had begun having panic attacks. Fast forward a few months to right before winter break my anxiety had become so bad I was barely functioning. I couldn't sleep, I was dropping weight, my nights were one long panic attack, I constantly couldn't breath, I wanted to die.\\n\\nOver winter break I started on escitalopram and it has been a very bumpy road. I was fine over the rest of break, but I still couldn't sleep. Right before I went back to college I went up in dosage, and started taking benadryl at night to sleep. I went down in dosage because it made me feel unfocused and uncoordinated. I continued to have freak out at nights until the benadryl knocked me out. I started to have dizzy spells but discovered it's because I was tensing my jaw and shoulders and my neck was stiff. Now most of the dizzy spells are gone, as well as a lot of the panic. I started to realize that anxiety had been ruling my life for years, it was just a loud mouth, false bravado, the cushion of a small home town, and an intense fear of being weak that kept me from noticing it.\\n\\nThe new thing that's popping up is having spells of feeling scared, sad, and alone. Every time I talk to people I keep thinking I'm too loud, I'm not funny, I talk too much, I cut people off. I immediately regret everything I did in the conversation. I'm afraid everyone actually think I'm just annoying, a loud mouth. They aren't as invested in me as I am in them, they just put up with me cause I'm there, or they just don't care about me as much as I care about them. Which of course is going to happen because I get way too invested in just a few close friends and I'm not going to be everyone's best friend, but I don't feel like I'm anyone's best friend. I'm scared I talk about my anxiety too much, I'm afraid I hide my anxiety too much. I'm afraid of not smiling and being happy, but I feel like exploding because I have other emotions than happiness damnit and I can't even express them to myself in private! \\n\\nThis sucks, it's just one thing after another, as soon as one gets better the next one starts. Sometimes I just feel so scared and alone.</th>\n",

Just small little ticks, fixating thoughts, and unnecessary worries...but like I said, I’ve never had any major breakdowns/etc. Any anxiety I’ve had normally last for 10-15 seconds then goes away. \\n\\nI had a few health scares this year but after further follow ups, I’m completely okay. But, those stressors really triggered some anxiety and fixating thoughts over the last month on unnecessary health problems.\\n\\nOn Saturday (12/16) I popped my neck sideways and immediately got light headed afterwards. We were on our way to a Christmas party and throughout the entire party I felt random tingling in my head, I kept leaving the party and walking around outside (which made me feel better). My heart was racing, head felt tingly, and my fingers felt numb. **After feeling like I was going to pass out and die** (on and off for 3 hours) my wife drove me to the ER.\\n\\nAfter thorough testing at the hospital, it was ruled as an anxiety attack. For example, here are all the tests I’ve had this year to confirm my “healthy” status. \\n\\n-\\tEKG (ER - 12/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tEchocardiogram (Dr - 11/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tTilt Table Test (Dr - 11/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tCBC (ER - 12/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tCMP (ER - 12/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tCT Scan of Neck (Dr - 11/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tCT Scan of Abdomen/Pelvis (Dr - 11/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tMRI of Head (Dr - 5/17 - Clear)\\n-\\tDoppler Ultrasound of Neck (ER - 12/17 - Clear)\\n\\nThe ER gave my Ativan that night and I went home and passed out...but now I’ve been experiencing constant WAVES of the feeling I had on Saturday night. **I feel broken.** My current symptoms include -\\n\\n-\\tMy head doesn’t feel clear at times (Light Headed / Numbness / Tingling / Tension / Random Ice Pick Pain)\\n-\\tRandom heart palpitations\\n-\\tFeeling “off” at times (fatigue)\\n-\\tEyesight doesn’t feel clear at times (almost like when you’ve started at a computer for too long and look up and your eyes are tired)\\n-\\tRandom nausea after eating\\n-\\tRandom tingling/aches in arms/legs\\n\\nNow, the hypochondriac in me is freaking out thinking there’s something physically wrong with me...but I’m starting to realize this could be anxiety. **Could all this be from anxiety which is resulting in the physical symptoms above**?\\n\\nI’ve never dealt with this before and I’m trying to get it under control. I’m trying to drink more water, control my breathing, and exercise more. I spoke with a Psychologist for the first time yesterday and I’m trying to face this head on...but obviously there’s times I “feel great” and other times where I feel “low” and that I’m going to pass out and have some sort of sickness. \\n\\nAny feedback/advice would be appreciated.

Boy was I wrong about that one. I really enjoyed studying it, and I'm really good at it, but I don't want to get a job in it. At all. Maybe down the track, yea, but right now the thought of going into a job that I could have for years and rob me of the opportunity of doing things like going back to study art, scares the living daylights out of me. \\n\\nMy partner thinks I'm stupid, and constantly looks at me like I'm letting them down if I don't \"use my law degree.\" But studying art is something I feel I've really got to do. I want to do the theory, I want to feel creative again, I want to learn different ways to be creative and go to the art gallery for hours again. I feel like I left my soul in my art room in grade 12, and went on to do something I should do.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, my goal in life is to work in the domestic violence industry, cause I've suffered with domestic violence and PTSD my whole life pretty much.

You really need a car. Which I don't have. and a licence to drive said car, which I also don't have. I feel so stuck in life and I'm unhappy. Waiting to hear back from a law job and whether or not I got into a bachelor of visual art... so I feel like the out come will determine what I do.

Then I reduced the volume from 10/10 to about 7/10. Finally I turned off the vibrate function.\\n\\nSoon both the frequency and intensity of my anxiety attacks decreased! I still have maybe one a week (still only on work days) but only once I get to work, and even then it's just some nausea and shortness of breath.\\n\\nI don't know exactly why or how it works but it does!

I've been reading about it, and from what I can gather venlafaxine is an SNRI as opposed to an SSRI, which means it acts on both serotonin and norepinephrine instead of just serotonin like citalopram. However, the norepinephrine effects apparently don't kick in until you reach a dose of 150mg or more. My question is, at 75mg is venlafaxine really any more effective than citalopram? It sounds to me like the effects of the two medicines are more or less the same at this dosage, so should I ask my doctor to increase my dosage? Has anybody made this transition before and found one to be more effective than the other, and did you have to take 150mg+ of venlafaxine before you started feeling better? Any stories or comments would be helpful, thanks guys!</th>\n",

I can blush when people are staring at me or when I think they are, and then I blush more because I believe they see my blushing and are judging me. I turn red and I want to run and hide. It mostly confused the people around me and they aren't very supportive or comforting, they mostly make it worse by pointing it out. Or they ask, \"why is your face so red?\" in a tone that make is seem bizarre and like they don't like it. Which makes me feel worse and I just want to cover my face. I only have one experience when someone was nice to me during a blushing attack I guess. I was in high school and a random boy talked to me, kinda flirting and I assumed it was a dare or a joke. I began to blush and he thought it was either funny or was weirded out but a girl next to me told him to leave me alone while I just buried my face in my desk not wanting to move. It made going into that class difficult every day after that and I felt bad that she had to step in and I felt like everyone in my grade would know what happened and I'd get a reputation for being odd.\\n\\nI also had a job once where a firefighter came in my line and I was blushing so much that I made him visibly uncomfortable and I was then more uncomfortable. I wasn't attracted to him it was just that the uniform represented like what women are \"supposed\" to be attracted to, and so my mind made me think that he thought I was attracted to him and that made me uncomfortable so the blushing began. So, anyway fast forward and I was at the same store I used to work at and I saw a group of firemen in uniform. I was able to walk by them with my cart and get in line behind them and I don't think I blushed. I didn't feel the initially panic or the warmness growing in my face. So, I think that's kinda a breakthrough and gives me some hope. I remember I had to walk past them and I braced myself in fear they would cause me to blush but, it was fine.\\n\\nThe more severe instances that I had was when one of my professors triggered the blushing so much that I stopped attending classes and eventually left school my senior year of uni without finishing.
