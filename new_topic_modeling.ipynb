       "����\\n\\nMy anxiety is always overwhelming at night, and I’d like to know if anyone has an evening routine that helps calm anxious thoughts and promote restful sleep. I’m aware of the common recommendations like taking a warm bath, cutting out caffeine, etc. \\n\\nDoes anyone have another strategy (specific to calming racing thoughts and falling asleep) to recommend?\\n\\nSome background info: \\n\\nI’m a young breast cancer survivor.  I went through a radical double mastectomy, several major reconstructive surgeries, chemo,  and radiation. Thankfully, I am in remission and taking powerful meds to keep it that way. I’ve always struggled mightily with anxiety, but after such intense medical trauma, it seems to have worsened significantly. I have two young sons, a part-time job, and a husband who travels extensively for work. Needless to say, I am super busy during the day and my mind is occupied. \\n\\nHowever, it seems the moment things slow down in the evening and bedtime approaches, my anxiety comes roaring back and I’m unable to relax and fall asleep (oh how I envy those who can fall asleep as soon as their head hits the pillow). \\n\\nI would be grateful for suggestions or examples of your nightly routine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "I dunno if this happens to anyone else, but I have Tourettes-like random vocal outbursts during the day. As in, an embarrassing memory would pop into my head and I'd have to scream/shout/say a random phrase, completely involuntarily, so that it goes away. I recently got an Amazon Echo and I guess I got so used to talking to it, that for about the past week the phrase \"Alexa please\" has been my vocal tic. Of course, my Echo would hear it and respond \"That's so nice, just ask me what you'd like me to do\". Since these verbal tics happen like a dozen times a day or more, I got really annoyed at hearing it from Alexa. So now I have this pavlovian reaction where my mind knows that if I have a verbal tic, my Echo would hear it and respond, which has resulted in these tics being quieter and less frequent than it's ever been. So thanks for listening, CIA-bot?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

My brain is jumping around everywhere and visualizing horrible, terrible things and I can’t get it to stop.  \\n  \\nEdit: Ok I think it’s been an hour or two and I’m back to being normal I think. I’m gonna try and stick with the medicine. I think that initial shock of having something in my system after not having anything really messed with me. Thank you all for being supportive and helpful. You really made it immensely easier to deal with everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "I dunno what to do or where to go from here. I've had anxiety since my mid to late teens and it's just gotten worse as the years go by. I don't even know where to begin...I guess suffice it to say that 6-7 years of panic attacks/daily anxiety // a psychotic breakdown that landed me in a mental ward for 10 days // being misdiagnosed as bipolar and put on meds that upped my anxiety/panic attacks to the point where I almost lost my job due to calling in every other day (due to Drs notes I slid by...).\\n\\nI don't know. I feel like a dog wearing a shock collar whose owner is sadistic as hell. When the panic attacks/anxiety first started I was adamant on fighting back however I could with all the resources that were/are available to me. But after being shocked so many times I'm just unresponsive...I've accepted this as my new 'normal'...even though I'll never completely get used to it. I'll continue to feel like every panic attack I have is the one that ends my life, I'll continue to fear driving longer than 5 minutes..especially in traffic. I'm just losing/maybe have lost my grip on trying to get back to being productive and fighting to have a nice life. \\n\\nI'm currently failing school, I literally have no will to go to class/keep up with homework. Things were going well until a couple days when I had hellish panic attacks. One while in the computer lab, one while in a 3 hour night class (which sucks even without anxiety lol). After those two times, I'm just freaked out about going to school. Freaked out about the drive, about being stuck in one position for an hour or longer. In my apartment is really the only place where I don't have MAJOR anxiety beating me down but then it's just replaced with depression...due to the fact that I'm letting my anxiety ruin my chance of succeeding in school...just shit. Life is shit for me. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I do? Should I seek treatment with benzos? I know they can be addictive but shit I need something to take the weight off my chest. I've done group therapy and either that particular group sucked or it just doesn't do me good. My pdoc at the time (who thought I was bipolar...I really think I just have GAD) had me on goddamned depakote and geodon, which I swear to God had me on like 2-3 panic attacks per day...grand times. Was on vistaril, didn't do shit for me...was on ativan for a short time and I think that did help although not a whole lot. \\n\\nI'm sorry for rambling I guess I'll TL;DR this fuck of a post: My anxiety is slowly but surely ruining my academic life and my social life...and turning me into a hermit. Anyways...THOUGHTS GUYS? \\n:(    1\n",
       "I dunno where I'm going with this. I'm sitting on the floor of one of the bathrooms in my office on an \"emergency bathroom break\" while stuff is piling up at my desk.\\n\\nI've had to deal with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, even before I knew what it was. I've gone my whole life putting on a smile and carrying on. Fake it till you make it, yeah? It's gone on long enough that I've gotten very good at it, and I feel like I'm not ever taken seriously when the cracks show because of it. I can't talk to anyone, because all I get is \"oh you seem fine.\" And I can feel the glares of every doctor I see thinking I'm just there for drugs, because I'm not visibly shaking constantly.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I'm afraid to go out on the patio at work on the 8th floor of the building, because I just stare at the edge and can't get the thoughts of jumping out of my head. I constantly feel like I'm a thousand pounds and can barely move, I'm so tired, I get dizziness, nausea, and Headaches constantly, I struggle to sleep more days than not, and am constantly terrified that people hate me, that I'm not taking care of my cat well, that I'm going to be fired, and any number of other things.\\n\\nEvery doctor I've been to in the past 5 years has either tried to scam me or barely talks to me for less than 5 minutes every few months, again not taking me seriously, and trying to even find one is near impossible, because I can't drive, talking on the phone terrifies me, and I'm terrified of spending money. Even though I have insurance, I'll never meet the deductible, so it's all just me stating at 200 dollar bills when I have 500 in my bank account and feeling mortified. Plus, none of what they have done has ever seemed to help.\\n\\nI know logically it's a matter of trying things until you get what's good for you, but I'm spending money I don't have on people who are hard to find, won't work with me, and won't take me seriously for what has up until now been ineffectual treatment, if not an outright scam. It's hard to get motivated.\\n\\nI can't get the feeling out of my head that if I just let it happen, had a real, hardcore meltdown, tried to jump, broke down crying and hid under my desk, stormed into a doctor's office and declared myself suicidal, that maybe for once I would be taken seriously, but I can't afford to lose that social capital. My job, the way people view me, it would all get worse, so I'm left here smouldering rather than going up like a bonfire in hopes that someone would throw a bucket of water on me.                                                                                    1\n",
       "I dunno where this started. I used to LOVE Halloween.. at least, I loved the planning of a costume, going trick-or-treating.. getting to be out after dark, playing make believe, getting candy (seriously.. who would dislike getting candy?)\\n\\nbut I've always had this problem with anxiety. I called it 'being shy' back in the day.. I hated knocking on doors, I got 'performance anxiety' with figuring out what I was supposed to say, when I should say it, and so on. All these strangers doors...\\n\\nThen at some point, one mean adult ruined Halloween for me, by snidely remarking that I was too old. After that, I stayed home, alone.\\n\\nI wasn't a popular kid, never really got invited to parties or anything.. and being an only child with parents that worked during the day, I was often sitting at home alone as the sun set, and the youngest Trick-or-treaters started traversing the neighborhood with their parents.\\n\\nThey'd ring the doorbell, and I'd freeze up. My parents expected me to get on the 'giving out candy' bandwagon.. but I started freaking out. Usually my Mom would come home relatively early, and then once she was home, I was free to just hide in the livingroom.\\n\\nFor a while, I was involved in some Star Trek clubs (RL) and we usually had a little get-together, so I often found someplace else to be. Then shortly after, I moved to a little town in Oregon.\\n\\nUp here, it rains a lot. And so the trick-or-treaters aren't too common. In fact, there have been years where we've bought candy, only to have no one even knock... but still, I've hidden in my room, or gone to a friend's house to avoid the door responsibility.\\n\\nAnd still, my heart jumps into my throat when the doorbell rings.\\n\\nThis year, I've moved in with the friend-I-used-to-go-over-to's-house.. so there's noplace for me to go and hide.\\n\\nHe's bought candy. He's decorated our little apartment window. He's essentially hung out a sign saying 'free candy, just knock'.\\n\\nAnd he won't be home til nearly 8pm.\\n\\nNow, it's true.. we're in an apartment complex.. but there ARE kids living here. with only a 15-30% chance of rain.. there's bound to be a few brave souls at least knocking on the decorated doors.\\n\\nAnd I'm home.. alone.\\n\\nI'm 43 years old, and I'm DEEPLY afraid of some little kid in a plastic mask knocking on the door.\\n\\nAll I have to do is turn the knob, say \"oh my gosh, it's iron man!\" and hand them a couple pieces of candy, then wish them well on their crime fighting...\\n\\nYet I'm still scared.                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "I dunno, just think I need something to vent off at.\\nSo, I live in North Carolina. And we're supposed to get hit by a hurricane soon. That stuff doesn't bother me, I'm just fine with having to deal with a hurricane. Scary, but not anxiety inducing. The thing that is anxiety inducing is the fact that ALL of my immediate family lives in NC, the farthest away being only 40 minutes. So if one of use gets hit, we're all probably getting hit. I'm grateful enough to live with my grandparents who are (sometimes incredibly annoyingly) paranoid. Sometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse. My grandma is 100% up to date and on the wheather and supplies and what not. The rest of my family, not so much. My aunt and uncle on one side of the family will probably take all the warnings for granted and assume they won't get hit or won't get hit bad. They always do dumb shit like that. They have four children, two who are legally adults but still live in the house, one thirteen year old and one six year old. I'm really starting to have bad anxiety about what will happen to the youngest two, especially if the parents don't listen to all the warnings and what not. I know none of this is my fault, and none of it is in my control, but if they do get hurt... I just can't bring myself to even think about what I do. All day my mind has been racing \"what if I could have a done this\" or \"I should have done that.\" Especially if the youngest gets hurt. Although he's my cousin, I love and protect him like he's my brother, nay, my son. He is my everything. Losing him, no, just him getting hurt would send me into a state of completely losing my sanity. Hell, it's driving me crazy just thinking about it. And it floods bad where they live just when it rains like normal, so a hurricane really could flood their house, and that's what terrifies me. Not to mention none of them can swim or can swim well.\\n\\nAt the very least I have some form of relief knowing my aunt and uncle on the other side of the family won't take any of this for granted. Knowing my uncle, he's likely already built a ladder to the moon in the event that it floods (lol). But even then I still keep having the same thoughts about how scared I am and how I wish I could do something to help out and warn everybody. Hell, invite them all over to my house just to make sure we'll have contact with each other and help anyone out if they need something. Buuuut, I can't. Thus only showing why I absolutely hate being a mature fourteen year old with terrible anxiety.                                                                                             1\n",
       "I dunno. I’ve been taking buspar for a while now, and it had been working like a dream. Lately, though, my partner pointed out to me that I’m back to having panic attacks daily. Once they pointed that out, I started to notice too, and it’s true. I’ve been having daily ones, I’ve gone back to waking up and *immediately* getting anxious, last night I texted them saying that I was convinced I was a bad person and going to hell which hasn’t happened in ages, and I don’t know.\\n\\nHas anyone else taken buspar here?

My excitement about what my future may have in store for me lasts about 15 seconds before I go right back into a state of self-loathing and guilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "excessive worrying. feeds anxiety i have gad i worry constantly. one time i really focused on avoiding mental stress and when i catch myself worrying about something i try to let it go. and not dwell on it further. after a few months i started to feel better than ever. my heart palpitations where gone, and my anxiety was lower.. i told myself i am better i fixed my health. and i started living my life without using my new thought patterns and after a few weeks. i got all my symptoms back. and i lost hope again.   what if worrying is the problem of all my symptoms. worry causes stress. and we worry all the time. so our body’s are basically constantly bombarded with stress. constantly in flight or fight state. this is keeping us sick. i know it’s hard to stop worrying and stop do stimulating things like watching intense movies. and play intense games. but i really think this is the root cause that we stay in this anxious state because we can’t heal until the mind is calm for a prolonged time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

       "trying to change my life... the risks are there �� i'm 21 yo, have studied russian at uni for almost two years and it hasn't gone great and decided to change majors to something i like more. literature science (not sure about the translation from swedish to english) i'm scared for a number of reasons. 1) not sure if i can get in, my grades from hs are part of getting accepted and i had a lot of problems back then so i have to rely on the entrance exam toget enough points. 2) i haven't told my parents in fear of them not approving (mum especially has a problem with 'cultural' subjects, tells me i won't get a job after and i'll just enjoy the uni years and then won't have a well paying job) and/or them micromanaging me because that's what they do. 3) i want to be a creative, have my whole life but i have had some bad feels about it until i've discovered more and more artists who i can relate to. still there are a lot of good authors/freelance writers who exist and i fear that i'll get forgotten in the masses. i have a lot of friends who support me, who i can trust. for the first time in my life i'm conflicted even though people who like me say that i should go for it and actually still want to go for it. i have to make a life change for me but in the past it's not worked out for me very well (take the hs experience that i am partly to blame for starting by myself. anyone who felt this way at some time who can give me advice? it would be greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "don't know if this is an accomplishment or pathetic, job application related so i'm 28, have my bs, going for a masters in the fall (woot!), so i'm trying to find work to tide me over for the next 6 or so months. ive gotten so discouraged from applying online that i said i would just go in person to retail places and apply to those. whether it's full or part time, i have a part time job already which got my hours reduced starting this week so i'd like to get something else. thing is, i have never walked in to a place of business to apply for a job before. i've gone to plenty of interviews and worked 3 different full time jobs, but the applying part always happened online and then chatting with the hr person on the phone. on monday, i printed out 7 copies of my resume and said that i would go out the next day to apply. well anxiety got the best of me, and i was surprised how many obstacles my mind put up. i felt very defeated on tuesday. wednesday i had to take a family car to get worked on and it ended up taking 5 hours, long story but i was okay with not searching for work that day. so yesterday, i tried again to go out and apply but just couldn't bring myself to do it, so i thought of a plan to sort of do an exposure response therapy deal: thursday evening i drove to the first place i want to apply to, pretending in my head that i was driving there to apply. so i just sat with that anxiety and watched it for awhile. today i was hoping to actually go and apply, but again i just found a way to throw up an obstacle. so i took it a step further today by shaving, putting on my dress clothes and shoes, have my folder with my resume, and i parked outside the store. i'm sitting here right now typing this, and whenever i look at or thinking about going in to the store, i can hear my mind going \"no no no,\" and i am nearly brought to tears when i try to force myself to get out of the car. so i'm kinda conceding that it won't happen today, but hopefully today and yesterday's efforts will enable me to go on monday (or sunday but i feel weird going on a weekend for some reason) i didn't touch upon this but a few years ago i had major fears of working at all after a bad depressive episode that left me equating work with suicidal thoughts and death, and it took a lot of therapy to get past that. i'm just so surprised that this step of applying in person is giving me so much difficulty when i'm so much better with applying online, interviewing, and working in general. part of me feels so pathetic.     1\n",

       "next step after zoloft / gaba i am on 100mg zoloft and 900mg (1/3 at a time) of gaba. the depression is much better, and the gaba helps with restless legs. i suspect this course of action, an ssri + gaba, is probably the common starting place now a days. what normally comes next? i told the doctor i don't have panic attacks, but do have a lot of anxiety, it just doesn't manifest in some sort of literal panic attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "my first panic attack i'm in high school, and on my schools tech team. at an meeting yesterday with 4 other members, we were all just doing our own thing when i got this burning, sick feeling in my stomach. i was wearing a tank top under my uniform sweater and was suddenly so self conscious i had to pull the sweater closed around me and hug my stomach. i sat down off to the side and zoned out for a little bit trying to stop my breathing from speeding up when one of the other members asked me a question about a show he was watching. when i didn't respond, he looked over at me and saw the look on my face and got concerned. i don't exactly remember what he said, but i know it was something like \"hey, are you okay?\" and i vaguely remember shaking my head no before stuttering out i was going to get some water in a super shaky voice.  i paced outside the room in the hallway for a bit before our oldest member came out and asked me what was going on and said stuff like \"we can't help if you don't tell us what's wrong.\" but i ended up just mumbling out and shaking that i didn't know. he eventually got me to come back inside where he and the student that initially asked me the question tried to get me to calm down but i just started crying. our oldest member called for my ex boyfriend (he's in the council and was at the meeting, we're still really close) and he came over and took me out to the staircase. he sat with me there for a little bit and just held me before helping me get my breathing under control.  i genuinely have no idea why this happened, as i can't think of anything that would have triggered it. it was a surreal experience. i've had anxiety for a few years now, and have had freak outs before but this was sooooo different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "can anyone else literally feel the hour their meds wear off? maybe it's psychosomatic but i've been on zoloft for 4+ years now for my gad and i swear i can feel the moment it wears off for the day. before when i took it around eleven at night (i get anxiety over wether or not i've taken my meds so i try to take them right before bed so i can't second guess myself) and overnight i'd feel a sudden, random spike of anxiety at 11. eventually it got to where when i felt this way, my first reaction would be to ask my roommate what time it was and she'd always be like \"11: med time then bed time.\"   i've even recently changed the time i take my meds and the same thing has happened again.   anyone else feel this way? i'm not really concerned about it, more just curious. i don't have any friends on anti-anxiety/depressants and am just really interested to hear if anyone else has experienced this.   thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and a double thanks to those who even take the time to answer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "\"my brother inherited our family anxiety 3 days ago and won't eat. he thinks there is something stuck in his throat but we took him to the er they did x-rays and scoped him and said he had some flim build up. they told him to take some mucinex and that was 3 days ago. 2 days ago he went to a throat specialist and they scoped him and found nothing and then cleaned his ears and said that his wax build up was so bad that he had to take drops daily in his ears and had to go back there every 6 months to clean them. now its today and he still hasn't ate. he eats the tiniest bite of chicken and thinks hes choking. my mother doesn't know what to do so she is taking him back to the throat doctor. my mother doesn't want him on alchohol or xanax or benzo's because i did when i was young and i turned into a serious drug addict and had to get help. our family has addiction in our heritage. anyway i'm kinda just venting and not really looking for too much advice because i've been where my 17 year old brother is and i know how scary it is when you first start getting the panic attacks. just need some people to talk to about it is all. \""
