       "����\\n\\nMy anxiety is always overwhelming at night, and I’d like to know if anyone has an evening routine that helps calm anxious thoughts and promote restful sleep. I’m aware of the common recommendations like taking a warm bath, cutting out caffeine, etc. \\n\\nDoes anyone have another strategy (specific to calming racing thoughts and falling asleep) to recommend?\\n\\nSome background info: \\n\\nI’m a young breast cancer survivor.  I went through a radical double mastectomy, several major reconstructive surgeries, chemo,  and radiation. Thankfully, I am in remission and taking powerful meds to keep it that way. I’ve always struggled mightily with anxiety, but after such intense medical trauma, it seems to have worsened significantly. I have two young sons, a part-time job, and a husband who travels extensively for work. Needless to say, I am super busy during the day and my mind is occupied. \\n\\nHowever, it seems the moment things slow down in the evening and bedtime approaches, my anxiety comes roaring back and I’m unable to relax and fall asleep (oh how I envy those who can fall asleep as soon as their head hits the pillow). \\n\\nI would be grateful for suggestions or examples of your nightly routine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "I dunno if this happens to anyone else, but I have Tourettes-like random vocal outbursts during the day. As in, an embarrassing memory would pop into my head and I'd have to scream/shout/say a random phrase, completely involuntarily, so that it goes away. I recently got an Amazon Echo and I guess I got so used to talking to it, that for about the past week the phrase \"Alexa please\" has been my vocal tic. Of course, my Echo would hear it and respond \"That's so nice, just ask me what you'd like me to do\". Since these verbal tics happen like a dozen times a day or more, I got really annoyed at hearing it from Alexa. So now I have this pavlovian reaction where my mind knows that if I have a verbal tic, my Echo would hear it and respond, which has resulted in these tics being quieter and less frequent than it's ever been. So thanks for listening, CIA-bot?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

I ended up not sleeping all that well and so this morning (for the first time) I took one of my antidepressants and holy shit I feel like a gasket just exploded. My brain is jumping around everywhere and visualizing horrible, terrible things and I can’t get it to stop.  \\n  \\nEdit: Ok I think it’s been an hour or two and I’m back to being normal I think. I’m gonna try and stick with the medicine. I think that initial shock of having something in my system after not having anything really messed with me. Thank you all for being supportive and helpful. You really made it immensely easier to deal with everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
       "I dunno what to do or where to go from here. I've had anxiety since my mid to late teens and it's just gotten worse as the years go by. I don't even know where to begin...I guess suffice it to say that 6-7 years of panic attacks/daily anxiety // a psychotic breakdown that landed me in a mental ward for 10 days // being misdiagnosed as bipolar and put on meds that upped my anxiety/panic attacks to the point where I almost lost my job due to calling in every other day (due to Drs notes I slid by...).\\n\\nI don't know. I feel like a dog wearing a shock collar whose owner is sadistic as hell. When the panic attacks/anxiety first started I was adamant on fighting back however I could with all the resources that were/are available to me. But after being shocked so many times I'm just unresponsive...I've accepted this as my new 'normal'...even though I'll never completely get used to it. I'll continue to feel like every panic attack I have is the one that ends my life, I'll continue to fear driving longer than 5 minutes..especially in traffic. I'm just losing/maybe have lost my grip on trying to get back to being productive and fighting to have a nice life. \\n\\nI'm currently failing school, I literally have no will to go to class/keep up with homework. Things were going well until a couple days when I had hellish panic attacks. One while in the computer lab, one while in a 3 hour night class (which sucks even without anxiety lol). After those two times, I'm just freaked out about going to school. Freaked out about the drive, about being stuck in one position for an hour or longer. In my apartment is really the only place where I don't have MAJOR anxiety beating me down but then it's just replaced with depression...due to the fact that I'm letting my anxiety ruin my chance of succeeding in school...just shit. Life is shit for me. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should I do? Should I seek treatment with benzos? I know they can be addictive but shit I need something to take the weight off my chest. I've done group therapy and either that particular group sucked or it just doesn't do me good. My pdoc at the time (who thought I was bipolar...I really think I just have GAD) had me on goddamned depakote and geodon, which I swear to God had me on like 2-3 panic attacks per day...grand times. Was on vistaril, didn't do shit for me...was on ativan for a short time and I think that did help although not a whole lot. \\n\\nI'm sorry for rambling I guess I'll TL;DR this fuck of a post: My anxiety is slowly but surely ruining my academic life and my social life...and turning me into a hermit. Anyways...THOUGHTS GUYS? \\n:(    1\n",
       "I dunno where I'm going with this. I'm sitting on the floor of one of the bathrooms in my office on an \"emergency bathroom break\" while stuff is piling up at my desk.\\n\\nI've had to deal with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, even before I knew what it was. I've gone my whole life putting on a smile and carrying on. Fake it till you make it, yeah? It's gone on long enough that I've gotten very good at it, and I feel like I'm not ever taken seriously when the cracks show because of it. I can't talk to anyone, because all I get is \"oh you seem fine.\" And I can feel the glares of every doctor I see thinking I'm just there for drugs, because I'm not visibly shaking constantly.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I'm afraid to go out on the patio at work on the 8th floor of the building, because I just stare at the edge and can't get the thoughts of jumping out of my head. I constantly feel like I'm a thousand pounds and can barely move, I'm so tired, I get dizziness, nausea, and Headaches constantly, I struggle to sleep more days than not, and am constantly terrified that people hate me, that I'm not taking care of my cat well, that I'm going to be fired, and any number of other things.\\n\\nEvery doctor I've been to in the past 5 years has either tried to scam me or barely talks to me for less than 5 minutes every few months, again not taking me seriously, and trying to even find one is near impossible, because I can't drive, talking on the phone terrifies me, and I'm terrified of spending money. Even though I have insurance, I'll never meet the deductible, so it's all just me stating at 200 dollar bills when I have 500 in my bank account and feeling mortified. Plus, none of what they have done has ever seemed to help.\\n\\nI know logically it's a matter of trying things until you get what's good for you, but I'm spending money I don't have on people who are hard to find, won't work with me, and won't take me seriously for what has up until now been ineffectual treatment, if not an outright scam. It's hard to get motivated.\\n\\nI can't get the feeling out of my head that if I just let it happen, had a real, hardcore meltdown, tried to jump, broke down crying and hid under my desk, stormed into a doctor's office and declared myself suicidal, that maybe for once I would be taken seriously, but I can't afford to lose that social capital. My job, the way people view me, it would all get worse, so I'm left here smouldering rather than going up like a bonfire in hopes that someone would throw a bucket of water on me.                                                                                    1\n",
       "I dunno where this started. I used to LOVE Halloween.. at least, I loved the planning of a costume, going trick-or-treating.. getting to be out after dark, playing make believe, getting candy (seriously.. who would dislike getting candy?)\\n\\nbut I've always had this problem with anxiety. I called it 'being shy' back in the day.. I hated knocking on doors, I got 'performance anxiety' with figuring out what I was supposed to say, when I should say it, and so on. All these strangers doors...\\n\\nThen at some point, one mean adult ruined Halloween for me, by snidely remarking that I was too old. After that, I stayed home, alone.\\n\\nI wasn't a popular kid, never really got invited to parties or anything.. and being an only child with parents that worked during the day, I was often sitting at home alone as the sun set, and the youngest Trick-or-treaters started traversing the neighborhood with their parents.\\n\\nThey'd ring the doorbell, and I'd freeze up. My parents expected me to get on the 'giving out candy' bandwagon.. but I started freaking out. Usually my Mom would come home relatively early, and then once she was home, I was free to just hide in the livingroom.\\n\\nFor a while, I was involved in some Star Trek clubs (RL) and we usually had a little get-together, so I often found someplace else to be. Then shortly after, I moved to a little town in Oregon.\\n\\nUp here, it rains a lot. And so the trick-or-treaters aren't too common. In fact, there have been years where we've bought candy, only to have no one even knock... but still, I've hidden in my room, or gone to a friend's house to avoid the door responsibility.\\n\\nAnd still, my heart jumps into my throat when the doorbell rings.\\n\\nThis year, I've moved in with the friend-I-used-to-go-over-to's-house.. so there's noplace for me to go and hide.\\n\\nHe's bought candy. He's decorated our little apartment window. He's essentially hung out a sign saying 'free candy, just knock'.\\n\\nAnd he won't be home til nearly 8pm.\\n\\nNow, it's true.. we're in an apartment complex.. but there ARE kids living here. with only a 15-30% chance of rain.. there's bound to be a few brave souls at least knocking on the decorated doors.\\n\\nAnd I'm home.. alone.\\n\\nI'm 43 years old, and I'm DEEPLY afraid of some little kid in a plastic mask knocking on the door.\\n\\nAll I have to do is turn the knob, say \"oh my gosh, it's iron man!\" and hand them a couple pieces of candy, then wish them well on their crime fighting...\\n\\nYet I'm still scared.                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "I dunno, just think I need something to vent off at.\\nSo, I live in North Carolina. And we're supposed to get hit by a hurricane soon. That stuff doesn't bother me, I'm just fine with having to deal with a hurricane. Scary, but not anxiety inducing. The thing that is anxiety inducing is the fact that ALL of my immediate family lives in NC, the farthest away being only 40 minutes. So if one of use gets hit, we're all probably getting hit. I'm grateful enough to live with my grandparents who are (sometimes incredibly annoyingly) paranoid. Sometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse. My grandma is 100% up to date and on the wheather and supplies and what not. The rest of my family, not so much. My aunt and uncle on one side of the family will probably take all the warnings for granted and assume they won't get hit or won't get hit bad. They always do dumb shit like that. They have four children, two who are legally adults but still live in the house, one thirteen year old and one six year old. I'm really starting to have bad anxiety about what will happen to the youngest two, especially if the parents don't listen to all the warnings and what not. I know none of this is my fault, and none of it is in my control, but if they do get hurt... I just can't bring myself to even think about what I do. All day my mind has been racing \"what if I could have a done this\" or \"I should have done that.\" Especially if the youngest gets hurt. Although he's my cousin, I love and protect him like he's my brother, nay, my son. He is my everything. Losing him, no, just him getting hurt would send me into a state of completely losing my sanity. Hell, it's driving me crazy just thinking about it. And it floods bad where they live just when it rains like normal, so a hurricane really could flood their house, and that's what terrifies me. Not to mention none of them can swim or can swim well.\\n\\nAt the very least I have some form of relief knowing my aunt and uncle on the other side of the family won't take any of this for granted. Knowing my uncle, he's likely already built a ladder to the moon in the event that it floods (lol). But even then I still keep having the same thoughts about how scared I am and how I wish I could do something to help out and warn everybody. Hell, invite them all over to my house just to make sure we'll have contact with each other and help anyone out if they need something. Buuuut, I can't. Thus only showing why I absolutely hate being a mature fourteen year old with terrible anxiety.                                                                                             1\n",
       "I dunno. I’ve been taking buspar for a while now, and it had been working like a dream. Lately, though, my partner pointed out to me that I’m back to having panic attacks daily. Once they pointed that out, I started to notice too, and it’s true. I’ve been having daily ones, I’ve gone back to waking up and *immediately* getting anxious, last night I texted them saying that I was convinced I was a bad person and going to hell which hasn’t happened in ages, and I don’t know.\\n\\nHas anyone else taken buspar here?

My excitement about what my future may have in store for me lasts about 15 seconds before I go right back into a state of self-loathing and guilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

       "i feel frustrated and invisible at the same time i don’t even know why i feel this way. i made some awesome friends in college over the last month and i’m having a blast. sometimes i’m thinking “glad there’s no assholes like in high school”. other times i just get overwhelmed and awkward with everything, so then i do want things to be different but i don’t at the same time. i’m not used to being around so many nice people. i’ve spent years learning how to ignore and cope with mean or average people. sure i had a few good friends in high school, but it balanced out. now it’s just nice people and i’ve realised that i don’t know how to be around nice people all the time.  then i’m just not that social. sometimes i would just sit on my own at lunch, then feel really awkward when i’m invited over to sit with people on the same course. but after that no one notices my existence and then i don’t even talk while i’m there because i don’t know how or what to say. they are so kind, but i constantly feel like i’m not returning the favour. at some point they will probably get sick of me. at least when i was treated like shit, i knew how to handle it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

       "just need some reassurance i have really bad anxiety in general, and especially when it comes to spending money. my whole childhood was never having enough money for things, and my parents working so much that 17 years later i'm just now starting to have a relationship with them because they had to be gone all the time to provide for us. i now have a son and so i'm his sole provider. i know logically right now he's set for diapers, wipes, etc for a while because of my stockpiling, and that i have enough food in the freezer/pantry and enough gas, etc, to be fine until i get paid. nothing outstanding i need to buy or pay, actually just bought him a new carseat last night. the problem being i'm totally good about buying things i need, or he needs, but spending the extra money on things we want makes my anxiety skyrocket. i'm currently having a panic attack in the tub because i spent $20 on chinese delivery out of the $50 i currently have left. knowing i don't have anything i need to pay, i have savings put away, all that, and i still can't shake feeling like i made a mistake ordering takeout because of all the 'what ifs'. its dumb, but i just need some reassurance that its okay to buy myself things sometimes :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "anxiety and excersize hi guys i have had majoy anxiety for a year now that's been effecting my life. or i should say was. i was and still am living the dream and travelling but the anxiety prevented me from doing a lot between july of last year and june 6th. i overworked myself with two full time jobs and collapsed and ended up in hospital with exhaustion and suffered panic attacks after that. i had been a heavy smoker of 9 years and i quit and i have to say my anxiety has almost gone. between day 14 and 19 of quitting smoking it was the worst anxiety i'd ever had i had to get a co-worker in twice to cover a shift and go home but when i got to day 30 i felt like a different person. i have anxiety now for one thing and that's excersize. i used to play rugby,soccer,squash,run,tennis and snowboarding in the winter you name it i played it but after two years of not excersizing i returned to sport after quitting smoking and i am now 242 pounds. last year in hospital i had xrays and everything and doctor told me because i was 25 i was low risk stroke/heart attack yet when i get on a running machine or have a big sprint in soccer and i feel my heart beat i think i'm about to have a heart attack. it goes away after 30 seconds in soccer but the other day i went home from the gym after 8 minutes on the running machine (gym's downstaris) and when i got in i just panicked for 15 minutes, tight chest like the anxiety i used to have. i sometimes think after junk food as well that i'm about to ahve a stroke and my girlfriend has to calm me. basically eating something naughty and excersizing gives me the worst anxiety. any advice please. but yeah i have overcome the anxiety i used to suffer or at least the scale has gone way down that i feel like i have defeated it in most aspects of life    1\n",
       "the slightest twitch in my stomach makes my anxiety go crazy i'll try and word this the best i can. sorry for the format, i'm on mobile. i self diagnosed myself with emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and the slightest twitch in my stomach makes my anxiety spike to scary levels. it could be gas, or stomach rumbling due to hunger, or acid reflux. it doesn't matter what it is, my anxiety will always spike because i'm afraid of vomiting. it's especially bad when i'm in public because the fear of not having a toilet to go to if i need to makes my anxiety even worse. is there any advice you guys could give me on how to cope with/overcome this? it's really starting to effect me socially and that's one thing i never wanted as i'm usually a very outgoing person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
