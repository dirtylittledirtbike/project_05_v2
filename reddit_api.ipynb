Do we even have a fucking future to look forward to? And before you say get off social media (Reddit is the only social media I use), drop the negative news, and live life, it won't make the pressing issues go away. I can't ignore just how bleak it all is. Deleting reddit won't fix the hard problems that comes with being poor with limited social mobility. And that's all just me and my self centered problems. The world itself is regressing thanks to ignorance, incompetence, corruption, and stupidity. We deserve what's coming to us in the form of climate change. We have had every possible chance to combat our inevitable  mass self extinction/suicide at every possible turn, yet we do nothing to stop it. So what's the point in striving for a better future, when there is none to be had? I just don't see it.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I’m 27/M currently living with my parents trying to figure out what to do with my life. I’ve been depressed since the last few years over my university failure. Despite hard work and long hours and doing everything I still did poorly (B’s and C’s). School has always been a struggle for me. I struggled to get decent grades in school as I’m not a smart kid and have multiple learning disabilities, so obviously university was going to be a struggle. I kept telling my parents that everything was fine when it wasn’t because besides the fact that they’d probably wouldn’t handle it well by yelling and berating me, I was ashamed and quite frankly in denial. It’s not like I was skipping class or partying constantly. No i struggled because I lacked to preparation for university level work. I’m not a very smart person at all. I know that. \\n\\nI know that there’s more to life than education work and intelligence but money is necessary to survive. I also wish that my parents understood my capabilities and suggested alternatives rather than pressuring me to go to university, when I clearly wasn’t at par with my peers. Not everyone can get straight A’s without trying or even with hard work. I’m certainly not one of them. \\n\\nAcademics aside, I am a very slow learner. I pick up things slower than most people and often need extra help. Having to work harder in school than most people has seaped into every part of my life. I know for a fact that I have below average intelligence. It’s literally the worst feeling in the world. It took a lot of effort to get decent grades in school and pass my university classes with ok grades. \\n\\nThe whole situation is just frustrating. Everytime I think about my past college experience, I get anxiety attacks and depression. I try to block it out of my mind. Sometimes I try to cope with it by pretending it never happened. \\n\\nNow at 27, I’m trying to figure out what to do with my life. But every time I try to do something I just sink back into depression and my motivation is zapped.',\n",

The second time I've been that down was around April/May this year, and I'm afraid the third wave is coming now.\\n\\nThe past few weeks have been super stressful. School, work, personal life, everything. I tend to escape the stress by sleeping, but even closing my eyes is scary now. Everytime I close my eyes I can see me hurting myself. In my imagination, I do cut, throw myself to a running car, or hang myself. I feel some strange physical reaction when those thoughts come across. The worst thing so far was when I keep staring at my arms, I had the urge to scratch it so bad, but I'm scared that it will hurt. I tried to suppress it by drawing lines on my arms using a pen, a pointy one so I can feel it scratching without hurting me.\\n\\nI'm scared and tired. I want everything to end but not really (you know what I mean??). It's been scary and lonely.\",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Yesterday I was able to push myself outside and go for a hike. However on this hike I chose a trail that I’ve had some personal issues with for about a year and a half now. You see the trail itself is fine. It’s a gorgeous walk that is hardly strenuous and goes through a plot of very old farmland that has since been retaken by nature. There’s a long stretch of stonewalls that used to mark the boundaries of the old farms cross crossing through out the forest. At a little over the half way point of the trail, one of these stone walls meets the path. It’s here that I always pause. I remember the first time I paused at this section of the trail. I used to take this trail to get home from work while listening to various podcasts. It usually was an autopilot mode kind of thing just to zone out and pay no attention to my surroundings. That is until one particular day I paused at one of these stonewalls. There was this intense pull towards the thick woods that this wall lead into, off the trail. It’s hard to explain how this gravitational pull felt. I stood there for a long while probably looking very bizarre to any other hikers that came by. Curiosity eventually led to a sensation of fear. I soon became worried of what I’d find in that enticing dark forest. For several months I would continue to pause at this spot feeling the same sensations of wonderment and fear. Both at the same time I would tell myself to never indulge in the curiosity and go off trail while also seemingly build up the courage and seek out what is in there. Unfortunately these emotions made stop going hiking this particular trail for a little over a year. That is until yesterday. \\n\\nIt’s fall so the outside work I used to do has primarily dried up and now I’m usually stuck inside. The lack of being exposed to the sun, poor eating habits, and taking to the drink again has been a wreck on my already unstable mental health. Things came to a crescendo yesterday and I decided that I just needed to go for a long walk with no distractions. Of course I decided to take the trail with the stonewall. Eventually I made to the same spot where I felt the same sensations. As per usual I stood there wondering  what was in there. Thoughts of my past choices and anxiety flooded my head this time around which sort of quieted the curiosity that I would normally feel. Little did I know that this flood was the very thing that needed to break the dam that I had built to silence that curiosity. I began walking off trail. I followed the wall for a while. Sometimes stumbling upon old farm equipment but mostly going deeper into solitude. It was quiet. The crickets are gone now thanks to the frosty nights, there were no birds out, not even the occasional squirrel to cackle at you as you walk past their tree. I walked for a good 15-20 minutes off trail when I found it. \\n\\nThe thick forest eventual cleared a little bit to a small pine grove. The forest floor was a carpet of soft green moss. The pines towered in a majestic confidence. It was here that I was feeling the pull for. I sat down on the moss for a while feeling complete, satisfied, accomplished. Eventually that led to a feeling of calm. My previous thoughts went away as all I could think of now was this pine grove and how perfect it was. \\n\\nAnd then the fear set in. I became scared of how perfect it was. Once the feelings of accomplishment for indulging in the curiosity went away I started digging into the fear. The very fear I had before when I would stare from the trail. \\n\\nThe nearest house from this pine grove is nearly a mile away. There are no roads nearby. As far as I can tell I was the only human contact this grove had experienced in a millennia. That was what caused the fear. That was what I tried to stop myself from ever following the pull in the first place. \\n\\nThis place is perfect.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'It’s literally been months and all I do everyday is cry like I can never fucking stop crying it’s like someone died but lmao nothing even happened I’m just crying all the fucking time I’m so SAD and so GUILTY that my family has to see me like this especially my mom she’s literally an angel and she’s having to deal with me being sad all fkn day it’s so unfair I’m such a horrible person for putting her through this. My dad is a Narc so I don’t feel too bad for him because he just feels jealous when I’m sad because it means I get some attention lol he goes through random fleeting moments of showing some mild genuine care about me but it passes too fast but despite that and despite how much he scares me and sad he makes me there’s still days I feel guilty even for HIM. Fucking hell \\n\\nAnyway I’ve been trapped at home since the beginning of this whole covid thing so it’s been like more than 6 months??? Feelings of not wanting to live and feeling so gloomy all day and hopeless all the time hit me after 2 months of living at home all day and being stuck with my parents all day. \\n\\nSo it’s been 5 months or so since I’ve been feeling this way and I just want it to fucking endddd. I have been working with my parents in their company like work-from-home or whatever but because I’m so SAD and always fkn CRYING and bc I wanna DIE I don’t rly get much work done so I feel so so so guilty that I’m not helping them w this ??? \\n\\nI’m such a fkn piece of shit ???? Why can’t I feel normal??? It’s not like I’m not fucking trying I even talk to a therapist and it helps for a day or two and then AGAIN baam I start feeling this way. My therapist is so fucking expensive I can’t even talk to her often\\n\\nI keep feeling like if the covid situation in my country becomes better and if I can start going OUT to work and have a routine again and meet friends properly again maybe I’ll eventually start feeling better but at the same time the idea of meeting friends and working makes me want to gag bc I rly think being alone is what I’m meant to do I just want to isolate myself and cry my life off \\n\\nAt the same time I keep thinking of times when I felt normal and so happy and motivated and it feels like another fucking life and another fucking person ??? \\n\\nI just want some relief I want something to dull the pain I want some hope I want something\\n\\nMy physical health’s been struggling too I’ve been having the fucking WORST stomach issues since 6 months so I can’t even get drunk lmao maybe it’s a blessing in disguise but fucking hell I can’t even eat tasty food I hate everything about this I hate it I hate it I hate it. I even have such bad TMJ pain most days I’m just always in actual physical pain \\n\\nI don’t even fucking know what I’ll become like idk what my future or career is I still need to figure out lol how tf should I do that when I don’t want to live anymore',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"34/M\\n\\nI'm not sure if this is an appropriate post here. \\n\\nI've just recently had a mental health assessment and I was found to be suffering from symptoms of serious depression and serious anxiety. Looking back at my life, it would appear that I have always been depressed. I don't think I wanted to admit it to myself.\\n\\nI have found that keeping a public journal helps keep my thoughts in order and helps me motivate myself. If it is ok with the members of this sub, I would like to post my journal here.\\n\\nI don't expect anyone to read it, and that is fine. The act of posting it publicly seems to be the thing that helps me.\\n\\nI have previously posted journals on various addiction subreddits as I exhibit a lot of very damaging behaviours, eg drug use, overeating, compulsive masturbation, emotional self-harm. I am working to keep these behaviours under control, but there are just too many of them. I think I can consolidate them all as symptoms of my depression and deal with them all here.\\n\\nStarting today, I am going to attempt to keep track of these behaviours, identify triggers, and see if I can find a path out of the weeds.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I will be seeking CBT and perhaps a course of antidepressants. I will keep you updated about my progress.\\n\\nThank you for reading.\",\n",

Delayed effect? \\n\\nPut my house up for sale that afternoon and left my ex no notice I left (I just took all my stuff and left).   \\n\\nI was also in the middle of taking on a new job where I worked from home so that was seamless to move.    \\n\\nIt was scary but the best choice ever.    \\n\\nLiterally all my stress was gone with moving away - even though I lived with my parents for 90 days or so until I got my own apartment in the same building until I bought my new house which was 5 years ago.  \\n\\nI then met my now wife and we have the best kid ever.   I love him so damn much it’s not even funny.    He’s my everything.    \\n\\nThis past year has been hard.    I got sick and have needed 2 surgeries and 1 additional procedure and work has been fine through Covid but I just feel the last bit I am drowning.   \\n\\nWe are “okay” financially but I am the only one providing (by design so my wife can raise our son to avoid the insane price of daycares but I’d rather her raise her than me) but working from home in a higher management role is hard with a noisy house (I love my kid is happy playing though) and to cap off 2020 which isn’t even over yet I lost my one dog suddenly (had health issues for as long as I can remember) and my older dog is coming to an end soon too - I think within half a year at best - I hope I’m wrong on that though.   \\n\\nI just feel so sad sometimes and foggy.   I don’t want to be on pills again - ever.    They made me so zombie like years back (with my ex fiancé) that I will refuse drugs.    \\n\\nI started smoking weed last year and I found it really helped but I don’t want to do that daily - maybe as a weekend outlet but I don’t want to be “that guy”.  \\n\\nWith my personality I feel I can’t talk to my wife as I do not like to express my feelings to anyone.  I’ve always been a closed book but I think maybe I should talk to someone professionally but then my benefits only covers $500 a year and then my anxiety freaks out if I spend more money on “me” rather than trying to provide.   \\n\\nI don’t know what to do.    I am laying on my couch with my old dog right now as she’s so lonely since her sister passed away so we try to always be with her right now as she struggles being alone but is hard to be around an active toddler as she’s old and is In pain (on meds for it) as that’s my normal morning routine as I am going back to work today after a short “vacation” I had to take post surgery a few weeks back.   \\n\\nAny help or guidance would be helpful.    \\n\\nI feel so lost and don’t know where to start.    \\n\\nThe only thing that helps me is',\n",

I post a few comments, don\\'t get any notifications after 15 minutes, so I go try to do something else for a bit. Anything to take my mind off the insurmountable debt I\\'ve put us both in in the last two months.\\n\\nI check back in on reddit a few hours later expecting a few replies, maybe some more questions I can elaborate on, nah. I\\'ve got probably 40 comments and messages about how Im wrong, how can I fuck up something so simple, how fucking dumb am I, etc., like god damn. Nuke my fucking karma. I don\\'t give a shit anymore.\\n\\nI understand a good majority of people *aren\\'t* like that, but some people just want to be toxic. And fuck it up for everyone else. I haven\\'t felt like this in a long time. I don\\'t even want to help anyone on this platform anymore, much less interact with it. No offence but fuck all of you. Sorry, you\\'re on your own next time. I\\'ve been struggling for years just to have somewhere stable to live, and those born with the silver spoon just want to throw it at the poor kid.\\n\\n\\nSorry. It\\'s switzerland. My fucking bad.\\n\\nRant over.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"So had this ex from 1.5 years ago. She was 8 years older. Well-rounded person. Yoga. Mindfulness. Vegetarian. Great career. High income. Wants children. \\n\\nMe: student, chainsmoker, poor diet, never achieved anything in life, skinny, parents died young, traumatized and abused, poor mental health, never thought about self-improvement. Just living day by day. Not ready for children. \\n\\nSo... I feel like I should end things because I'm obviously wrong for her. However, she had already booked a plane ticket 6 months in advance and I dump her via a phone call 4 weeks before she'd fly over. It wasn't meant to be that harsh, but I just finally gathered the courage to say it and after that she becomes fucking angry, I back off, the situation turns hostile and everything sucks. Eventually we meet one last time in her hotel and have good closure. She calls me one last time like 6 months later asking to fly over to forgive me, but I'm like 'mweh...' and don't follow up on it. Dumb. I really regret that because I thought that what we had was very special. I loved her deeply. She's one of my favorite people in the world.\\n\\nThen like one year later I become so suicidal. Why? Well around the time I broke up with her, I started working out all the time, I got a healthy diet, gained more than 15 kilo in weight, quit smoking, graduated, got a job and so on. However, I'm just looking at my past and it's like... Fuck man 🤦\\u200d♂️ For 8 or 9 fucking years I didn't pay ANY attention to my diet and just constantly smoked cigarette after cigarette and spliff after spliff. Healthy people die of cancer or heart attacks in their 30s or 40s all the time. WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING. My grandma dies too so I get hit even more heavily with the fragility of life. So I spiral and I spiral and I think to myself: I can't even fucking start a family now with good conscience. I'm the worst fucking loser on the planet. Seriously, fuck me! Only fucking idiots live like I did. I don't deserve this life. I hate everything and can't go on like this with this unbearable regret.\\n\\nSo then I contact my ex that I miss her and everything, wondering what 'could have been' and so on. In my head it's like 'ah man, if I had always lived like I'm doing now I would have been ready for a relationship with her' and I really want to talk with her. She takes it as an attempt to get her back though so she's like 'grow up, get a grip, you're the worst dumper ever, I've improved a lot since then' and then she blocks me.\\n\\nAt that point I'm just convinced that I have to kill myself because I hate myself so much and can't live with the sword of Damocles hanging above me. In a random impulse I then do something extremely stupid... Maybe to motivate myself a bit more and also as a last desperate cry for help I tell her 'fuck improving, I'm done with life, pointless bullshit anyway, you still want my cat?'... Then she gets angry (obviously). I tell her 'I just think it's too late!', she replies 'nothing is too late, you're just living in your tragic mind' and blocks me again. I make a new account to explain why I said that. 'So what? You were born healthy and wholesome so it was your choice to live in a dumphole!' and 'You regretting this and that, THIS is unbearable'... I start crying and crying about everything. She constantly engages and then blocks me and I'm feeling like 'stop this fucking blocking and just listen to me because I'm going through the worst crisis of my life!!!'... Eventually she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards' so I make a new account and briefly tell her that I did change with working out and so on. Then it continues a bit more. Eventually she's clearly fed up with my shit and tells me 'I can't stand listening to your whining'... I agree to really stop contacting her after this. Then, like 2 days later, I feel like 'hm, but I gave off the wrong vibe by saying fuck improving and so on, actually I've really turned my life around so I've changed a lot! I should tell her that!' so in an impulse I make a new account and tell her 'but I did change'...\\n\\nWell that was when she decided to end me. She wrote the most triggering, hurtful and soulcrushing message possible for me at that moment. Like if you're trying to cut as deep as possible with me, then you should say those things. For example, she said 'you'll never learn how to live your life'... My biggest nightmare. I also realize that I don't really want to die, but I just don't know how to deal with my unhealthy past and that's why I was searching for a wrong solution with suicide. Great! Now I have her shit repeat in my head because I started doing batty shit due to my terrible mental health.\\n\\nSo... The next 6 months after that message is the biggest hell ride I've ever been on. Just CONSTANTLY hearing her shit repeat in my head all the time. Feeling so insanely hurt. Broken spirit. Then I dug an even bigger hole for myself because out of desperation I just kept spamming her all the time. To be honest I'm a fucking hypocrite because I insulted her back too and thought horrible things about her because I thought 'who the fucks hits someone who is already down? what the fuck and I dumped you because I had to and not because I wanted to while I could have been a sociopath and abused you for my own selfish gains'... It was so fucked up what she told me and it has really ended me so besides feeling sad I also felt rage towards her sometimes and that's very wrong of me. Most of it was just explaining, begging to talk it out and kissing her feet though. She never replied. \\n\\nAnd you know what? Who can blame her. I bother her with some weak tea about thinking I'm going to die young while I dumped her and keep talking while she constantly tells me to stop contacting. She only thinks of negativity with me. I dumped her in a shitty way... I come crying to her with my suicidal thoughts due to my own poor life choices. I totally deserved her anger, but the pain isn't disappearing with that and I really hate how much progress I've missed out on by ending up in this situation. It has really ruined my self-esteem and self-respect. Fuck. I can't stop thinking about it either. It's so messed up. This has completely wrecked me. I'm feeling so bad about my behavior and myself. How can I ever get over this? :(\",\n",

I've been through so many friend groups that treat me like dogshit and then they backstab me and I'm left alone. Why, don't they understand?\\n\\nHe decided he wanted to know why. I told them there's a lot, Child Abuse, Bullying, Bad Friends but he said oh well, your probably overthinking it and you want to be depressed. Wtf, no I don't want to be depressed, I never asked to be this way. I never asked for any of this shit. Then he drops a wildcard and says well think about it. You should be grateful, you live in a 1st world country, free food, water, a house but your still depressed? People are starving and dying in poor countries. I hate it when people pull that card, it's so dumb. I know and I feel empathy but your saying if I be grateful=happiness. No, no that's not how it works, I'm so grateful for my position but that means I have to be happy? It's ridiculous.\\n\\nThen he just gave up calling it bullshit, why are they so misunderstanding? I hate it. If they explored my mind they would get it. There's only 1 other depressed person just like me in my life, she gets everything, she gets my perspective, and yet social anxiety takes that privilege away from me. I'm fucking alone and no one gets it, my only friend is music. My dad and psychologist don't take it seriously and I fucking hate it. \\n\\nI hate everything, no one understands.

But, I went through a brief time of happiness in my life and honestly thought that being suicidal was behind me.\\n\\nWell a few months into my wife being pregnant I lost my job, tried a start-up business that failed, then 2020 happened, and I've generally slipped back into beuing full on suicidal, but now with a perfect little bundle of joy 1 year old who has me anchored to living.\\n\\nSo now instead of being suicidal I can only hope for the world to end. I can't die unless my whole family dies. I wake up in the morning and I have to think about the possibility of a nuke being dropped on my city to calm my panic because thinking about killing myself just makes me more upset now knowing what it would do to my daughter.\\n\\nBut suicide is something that always felt in my control, now I feel like I don't have control over my being able to die unless I became a full on familicide psychopath.\\n\\nI regret allowing myself to become hopeful towards life long enough to have a kid. Growing up I wish my parents hadn't had me and I'm afraid one day my daughter will feel the same. I won't be able to disagree with her, it was probably a huge mistake.\\n\\nBut now being alive feels more claustrophobic than ever and it's sends me into daily minor panic attacks.\\n\\nI don't know where I'm going with this. Just been feeling this way for so long and obviously will never be able to say any of these things out loud. Just needed to put them down somewhere.\",\n",

       "i don't even know how to say anything i want to properly. i don't even feel real right now. i have so many things to say and no ways to express them. i have always been second choice to everyone. i don't think i've ever known anyone that considered me as important to them as they are to me. even on this stupid website i try to be active in communities and just socialize and meet people but nobody wants to reply to me, and i feel like an outcast in every single way possible. i shut my parents out entirely from my private life because in the past when i tried to have an open, honest relationship with them it has ended in me being invalidated, shot down, ignored, or yelled at. i hide my drug abuse from my friends because they are judgmental and condescending and don't understand that it isn't as simple as \"just stop.\" i can't seem to have genuine connections with anyone i feel like some sort of freak that doesn't belong anywhere. why can't i just be normal? i cannot describe with words how empty my chest feels right now. i am about to break. i'm about to bfucking break i can't take this much longer i can't keep feeling like nobody cares i can't keep being the outcast i cant' keep living like this i need it to stop now i either have to kill myself tonight or change and i'm SORRY for being like this but if you're reading this please say something, *anything* to me because i feel so god damn insignificant that i cannot handle it anymore, this is absolutely my breaking point. please just for once i want to feel like someone is listening to what i'm saying i'm sorry mods please remove this if i violated rules i just am at such a complete loss that i turned to posting to a website to feel any kind of emotion other than insignificance i'm sorry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       15\n",
       "When I was younger, I didnt want to keep living but I was too much of a coward to quit out. For the last number of years, I've been pretty happy since I've been able to keep a steady job that i enjoyed. I've lately come to the realization that i dont want to live alone anymore.\\n\\nNow this pandemic has made me lose my job so now i have nothing to do all day. I did find someone on a dating app who i like but i have no idea if they like me back which is killing and now most days I'm just miserable the whole day. Just being alone all the time is the worst and I need human interaction.\\n\\nI dont have any expectations from from this post other than I needed to get this off my chest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              14\n",

       "I’ve been so alone ever since college started 4 months ago. The only time I leave the house is if it’s to go to the gym, get food or groceries. I don’t have friends to hang out with. My Friday nights and weekends have been spent watching Youtube and Netflix until 3am.\\n\\nI saw a post about isolation and someone commented saying prolonged periods of isolation is bad because you get to a point where you’re used to it  and going outside seems more difficult. \\n\\nThat’s been happening recently. I’ve been skipping more classes at college. I’m not worried about getting close to people since I lost all my old friends and don’t wanna put the effort in trying to make new close friends.\\n\\nI’m in a hole I can’t get out of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "I’ve been slowly trying to get past my depression, and a week or so ago I actually felt pretty normal for the first time in a very, very long time. And it lasted a couple of days. But then I started feeling really anxious again, which led to overthinking which led me back to my depression. It feels horrible especially because I think about this person that I miss all the time, which makes me super depressed because there’s so much more attached to it than just him, but he mentally seems to represent a lot of my depression. \\n\\nI don’t want to miss this person. If I could move on and find somebody else I would, but that’s not a possibility for me. I have such slim chances as a gay person, especially a chubby (though cute haha) gay person. In Vermont... I know that being with someone wouldn’t cure my depression but I crave that physical contact and the admiration so much. But of course there’s nothing I can really do. I just feel so horrible and I feel like I can’t really talk to anyone about without feeling annoying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
       "I’ve been slowly spiraling down getting worse and worse mentally with things that have been happening but it’s not what I want to talk about today. I did the one thing that was super hard. I reached out to those around me for help. Guess what? No one helped. In fact they kinda dismissed it. That’s multiple groups of family and friends. So now I’m here alone and spiraling down the drain of depression and anxiety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "I’ve been sitting here typing and deleting not knowing where to begin. I’m turning 26 in two weeks. I’m a few classes shy of finishing an associates degree from a community college which I stopped attending two years ago due to debilitating depression and anxiety. \\n\\nBackstory:\\nI went to a very prominent all-girls high school. I started developing severe depression my sophomore year.  Part of it was because of the way I was raised by strict, Hispanic parents. My mother definitely deals with undiagnosed mental health issues, which ultimately left me mentally, and sometimes physically abused by my parents. They constantly compared me to other friends and would put me down. I was at the top of my class, when the beginning of junior year I had a mental breakdown and dropped out of school. I spent the next year lying in bed, sleeping, barely eating, and binge watching tv shows. I started an online high school, which of course I couldn’t handle so stopped that. Around my 20th birthday, I decided to get my GED. Didn’t even study for it and ended up acing it. This gave me the confidence to walk into a community college and start classes. I finally felt like I was doing something to better myself and live up to the potential I know I have. Two years in, the depression escalated again and I stopped attending school. During this timeline, I worked a few customer service/sales/retail jobs. I am currently a shift supervisor at a retail chain. I make anywhere from 18-24 dollars an hour depending on commission. I was able to move out of my abusive home into an apartment with my boyfriend. My birthday is rapidly approaching and I’m once again reminded of that 16 year old girl that dropped out of high school 10 years ago. I have been living in the shadow of that monumental mistake for years. I’ve alienated pretty much anyone that has ever been in my life due to shame. Most people I grew up with expected a rewarding career for me based off of my high intellect, yet I’m stuck in the most unrewarding, soul sucking job.  \\n\\n\\nI feel lost, stagnant, hopeless, and ashamed. I don’t know what to do with my life. All I want to do is graduate college. I want to wear a cap and gown and have my loved ones celebrate me. But I don’t want to finish unless I know that it will yield a rewarding career, and that I’m mentally and emotionally committed. \\n\\nI guess I’m looking for some guidance or words of encouragement. I don’t want to be 30 and working in a clothing store.       1\n",
       "I'm going through a lot right now and am struggling to handle everything alone. I was kind of OK yesterday, but today I woke up very depressed. Suicidal thoughts are creeping back, and I'm scared. Everything just seems so hopeless. I'm scared, I'm angry and I'm so very tired of being alone. I don't want to die, but I can't find even a sliver of hope to hang on to. Please, can someone say something that will make me want to live?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
